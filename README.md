# logic

This is the repository for my implementation of the tasks in _Mathematical Logic Through Python_ (2022) by Yannai A. Gonczarowski and Noam Nisan. The book is great, as are the tasks and tests they've developed for it, so I highly recommend trying it out for yourself. You can purchase the book (and thereby support the authors) or download the bare-bones code at https://www.logicthrupython.org/.
